Full use of your multi-core CPU by BatchRun.

This is a project in GoogleCode, if you are interested in the old code, you can find it [here](https://code.google.com/p/batchrun/).

In the first edtion of this project, I use pp to control processes. In this lastest version, pp is not used anymore. Standard library is quite enough for this project.

I am trying to prettify the output by adding Pid in front of the output, but I cannot work it out. If anyone can improve this, I will be very appreciated.
